There is only One Thing going on in the Universe.


It is cosmic geometry because it provides us a model upon which to render and map the dynamic interactions and manifest structures of energy-matter-information at all scales, from Planck (the smallest that is theoretically possible to measure or otherwise experience from our scale) to Universal. 

Cosmography is the study of the fundamental patterns, structures, processes and systems that are in- herent in manifestation at all scales within the cosmos.

All of these are ways of looking at one thing — energy-matter interactions, or what I call energetic articulation. It is essentially a visual language of form and flow that we can use to discern and describe how energy articulates in both rigid and fluid forms. As mentioned above, it has a basic set of components that are utilized for this study:

**Patterns, Structures, Processes & Systems** [screenshot]

- The cosmos (more specifically, the vacuum of space) is Quantized, and there is a primary “ground state” of quantization at the Planck scale. As such, spacetime is granular as “pixels” on the structure of space.

- The cosmos is Holographic — the inherent wholeness is present at every point.

- The cosmos is Fractal — there is a repetition of fundamental patterns (cosmic geometry) at all scales from Planck to Universal.

- Matter (asset), Energy (interactions) and Information (transactions) are three ways of describing one phenomenon — elec- tromagnetic wave interaction originating at the Planck scale.

- There is an intrinsic feedback/feedforward loop (toroidal geometry) of cosmic “intelligence” (as information) informing both the universal wholeness and all manifest entities within it simultaneously. 

- Gravity, confinement and the nuclear Strong Force are one and the same — they are the result of electromagnetic interactions from Planck to Universal scales.

- The information about all protons is present in every proton as a generalized holographic principle.

**In Short**

There is a universal field of quantized electromagnetic wave interaction creating a generalized holographic interference pattern that manifests as discrete fractal boundaries of energy-matter (asset-interaction)-information (transactions) across a gravitational density gradient from Universal to Planck scales (and beyond) in which the information of the whole is present in every point and the information of each point is shared throughout the whole.

**Music**

Harmonic Structure

The resonance and damping of waveform interactions that define a pri- mary set of ratios found in music systems that are also inherent in the manifestation of physical form, as well as in the cosmic “ground state” field itself.


Rhythmic Structure 

Cycles of time and the quantization of pressure impulses (sound) within the generalized spacetime field.


12-Tone System

Music has an intrinsic 12-tone system of relationships that is fundamental to cosmic geometry. 

System is italicized to emphasize what is being stated here; that there is a way of studying the relationships of waveform interactions as a system independent of the actual frequency structures at play, and this system is based upon a 12-tone relationship at its most fundamental level of equilibrium and wholeness.

In our model of wholeness, music presents us with a structure for harmonic and rhythmic proportions that are inherent in the quantized nature of the cosmos. 

**Three Components, One Thing**

They are, once again, simply lenses through which we can view, analyze and map one thing: energy-matter-information in- teractions that comprise the observable universe as well as the conceptual foundations (the (presently) non-observable aspects) upon which it is manifest.



## Wholeness

Three components that combine to describe one phenomenon: universal dynamics of energy and matter manifesting in physical form and flow. 

Three lenses through which we can look at one whole system.

Cosmometry - patterns, structures, processes and systems found at all scales

Unified Physics - a theoretical framework that unifies quantum and relativistic forces and scientific disciplines

Music (a universal system of harmonic relationships of resonance)

It appears that the entire cosmic phenomenon and our experience of it is composed of three fundamental attributes — 

Electromagnetic Radiation-Gravitation
Acoustic Compression
Information.

The three attributes of Electromagnetism (Light), Acoustic Pressure (Sound), and Information (Consciousness) are what comprise Energy-Matter-Information or Asset-Interaction-Transactions, the “three components, one thing

There’s only one thing going on in the cosmos, and it’s this one thing manifesting as electromagnetism, acoustic pressure and information that we’re exploring as Wholeness.


## Starting From Zero

**The Empty Circus**

The zero starting point for happenings & non-happenings: it is the empty theatre & empty circus & empty universe ready to accomodate any acts and any audience

Every time we look at a blank page, a blank canvas, an empty stage, we are experiencing as close as we ever will the presence of the Vector Equilibrium as the zero starting point for all experiential reality.

From the perspective of energy dynamics, he is saying that the Vector Equilibrium (VE for short) is the geometric form that is the mathematical zero reference for our 3-dimensional experience of reality (called “spacetime” in physics) wherein all positive and negative differentials are in perfect equilibrium equal to zero.

He goes on to say, “Zero pulsation in the vector equilibrium is the nearest approach we will ever know to eternity and god.”

This simple geometric form is the origin of all dynamic activity in the cosmos; origin meaning it is the zero reference of equilibrium around which exists all oscillating vibration and movement, and within that movement emerge the resonant structures of atomic, molecular, crystalline, fluid, gaseous, biolog- ical, planetary, solar and galactic forms of matter.

**Consciousness and the Human Experience**

*Being Aware of Being Aware*

Traversed a variety of ways in which we can explore one unified phenomenon — the universal dynamic of energy-matter-information in¢forming the cosmos at all scales. 

We have consciousness. And we’re aware of it. We are self-aware be- ings having a human experience here on this small planet.

We know our bodies are an integral part of the natural world around us, sharing the same fundamental biological systems and processes as found in other organisms. But what of our minds, our emotions, our intelligence and innovative creativity,

In a holofractal model of the cosmos, though, this kind of anomaly doesn’t make sense, suggesting instead that it’s more likely these attributes **have emerged from the very foundation of the cosmos itself** — that our experience of consciousness and self-awareness is an inevitable evolutionary product of the **same attributes** being present throughout the entire universal structure.

The question of how consciousness emerges from a randomly evolving physical universe has been a challenging inquiry in physics for a long time.

What if we were to allow ourselves to view these realms otherwise? What if we set aside the historical taboo of letting spiritual beliefs of a universal intelligence bleed into scientific models?
 
Can we consider such a scientific model without incorporating religious ideology and still be open to the validity of this universal intelligence?

My intent is to round out the picture of all that has preceded this section with insights into how the universal field of energy-matter-information moves within, through and as us,

**Consciousness**

Exploring the nature of the very thing that allows us to explore the nature of itself — consciousness. 

Let’s start with some attributes that we can say are at least partially descriptive of that which we call consciousness:

• Awareness
• Intelligence
• Perception of environment
• Reflection (as in self-reflection or subject/object relationship)
• Volition and Response (e.g. will, free will)


Elements that engender awareness

• Diversity of Parts (functional complexity)
• Information Processing (sensitivity to states)
• Memory (recording of information, state hysteresis)
• Communicability (reception and transmission of information/energy)
• Integration (emergence of system as entity)

Integrated systems composed of a diversity of parts that record, process and transmit information and energy in response to environmental states with intelligent action and awareness of self and other.

Could it be that these attributes of consciousness permeate all scale, as do cosmic patterns and musical harmonics?

In our general model of cosmic wholeness, we have a primary ground state at the Planck scale — the electromagnetic matrix of Planck Spherical Units (PSUs) in zerophase equilibrium. 

This ground state is the unified aether field in which all dynamics of energy, form and flow emerge as fractal manifestations.

The PSUs are proposed to be the base “pixel” resolution of our universe, ss such they comprise the prime “bits” wherein all information of all events throughout all time is stored.

PSU matrix is entirely hologramic, with all of the information of the entire cosmos present at every point. This is the absolute hologram.

Everything that manifests within this universal hologramic medium is then a localized expression of energy, form and flow with a spe- cific set of information pertinent to itself — i.e. the Relative Hologram.

The Relative and Absolute are always-and-only in continuous reciprocal relationship (Bohm’s Implicate and Explicate orders), and it is this reciprocal exchange of local and universal information that provides the feedback/feedforward function

Every local entity (integrated system as relative hologram) both informs and is informed by the cosmic totality (universal wholeness as absolute hologram) with the information exchange occurring every Planck Time *~5.39 × 10−44 seconds, or 1044 times per second*

This information flow is fractally transferred and increasingly localized up in scale as it in¢forms the atoms, molecules, intracellular, cellular and biological systems in all living organisms. 

The biological **Nested Rhythm Network**, the harmonic system of light, sound and information that permeates all spacetime in a unified diversity of parts.

There is a universal field of electromagnetic energy (superspace) that receives, records and transfers information about every event such that, at eery moment, each event informs the universal field and the universal field informs each event about every other
event in an ongoing reciprocal exchange.

It is this field of information storage and communication called the **Unified Spacememory Network (USN)**. Obviously, we have a new term here to define — **spacememory**.

The unified nature of space and time is spacetime. One does not exist without the other.

The very idea of time is predicated on one essential attribute, the lack of which would make the comprehension of time impossible — memory. No memory = no time. 

Memory plays a systematic role in the cosmic structure.

It is at this interface that Haramein and colleagues propose the presence of a Planck-scale “wormhole” network that connects all physical matter into a unified information system that communicates at superluminal (faster than the speed of light) rates of transfer — essentially instantaneously.

This ubiquitous information network is seen to be the mechanism for the experimentally verified phenomenon of quantum entanglement, wherein two or more particles (such as photons) are linked across vast distances with no lag time for a change of state from one to the other. 

A cosmically unified network of quasi-instantaneous information exchange.

**The Unified Spacememory Network: From Cosmogenesis to Consciousness**, that offers an overview perspective:

“Underlying the matter that comprises living systems, there may be memory imprint- ing into the planckian wormhole-spacetime structure, in which time is a function of information on the structure of space during the universal evolution. Memory and recursive information feedback/feedforward processes of the quantum vacuum allow for learning and evolutionary behavior. This applies not only to the mesoscale of the biological organism, but also to physical systems ranging from the planckian to the cosmological scale, and the universe as a whole. As such, the process of cosmogenesis can be equated with a living, or biological process of iterative evolutionary development — biological cosmogenesis. In this sense, there are living processes occurring at all scales of the universe, and with memory and learning being functions of awareness, life and consciousness are intrinsic ubiquitous characteristics, embedded in the very dynamics and mechanics of physical processes of the quantum vacuum structure and thus, the universe itself.”

The very attributes of consciousness that we began this chapter with are now seen not as special-case qualities unique to us higher-order intelligent beings but as inherently present characteristics found throughout the en- tire cosmos, from Planck to Universal scales.


From this perspective, the emergence of self-awareness as we experience it is an inevitable outcome of universal information feedback/feedforward processes of what we call intelligence that combine through ever-increasing fractal complexity into a synergetic whole called (in our case) a human being. 

**We know that we know, and the more that we know, the more we will know in synergetic wholeness, and this is how the entire universe is learning and evolving as a living, conscious entity at every scale.**

USN model suggests is that consciousness is present throughout the universal field and that our biophysical systems of brains, nerves, tissues, organs, cells, biomolecules, etc. are func- tioning as a fractal antenna that is receptive to this field.
