# Mad Tesla's Lab

The experience took only four minutes, but its immersive intensity dilated time. Our eyes popping, our hearts racing, our lungs swollens, we felt as if we had been in the journey for two hours. At least. We had actually undergone a form of time travel

Like the earth, the Universe is not flat. 

Meager and deterministic theories that see the universe as shear matter, ruled by physics and chemistry alone, leave no room for human consciousness and creativity.

Just as a 3D ride-film transcends a 2D movie, other dimensions of experience are transformative and artistically real

From our minds open potential metaverses, infinite dimensions of imaginative reality—counter-factuals, analogies, interpretive emotions, flights of thought and creativity.

If you lived in a two-dimensional landscape painting, how would you respond to someone earnestly telling you that the 2D image was just the faintest reflection of a real 3D world? 

Comfortable in the cave of your 2D mind, you had 2D theories that explained all you experienced in flatland—the pigments of paint, the parallax relationships of near and far objects, the angles and edges. 

he math all jibed. 

“Three dimensions?” you might ask. 

“I have no need for that hypothesis.

Open doors of perception

The Internet has not delivered on some of its most important promises.

Under Google’s guidance, the Internet is not only full of unwanted ads but fraught with bots and malware. Instead of putting power in the hands of individuals, it has become a porous cloud where all the money and power rise to the top.

On a deeper level, the world of Google—its interfaces, its images, its videos, its icons, its philosophy—is 2D. 

Google is not just a company but a system of the world. 

And the Internet is cracking under the weight of this ideology. Its devotees uphold the flat-universe theory of materialism: the sufficiency of deterministic chemistry and mathematics. 

They believe the human mind is a suboptimal product of random evolutionary processes. They believe in the possibility of a silicon brain. 

They believe that machines can “learn” in a way comparable to human learning, that consciousness is a relatively insignificant aspect of humanity, emergent from matter, and that imagination of true novelties is a delusion in a hermetic world of logic. 

They hold that human beings have no more to discover and may as well retire on a guaranteed pension

While Larry Page and Sergey Brin fly off with Elon Musk and live forever in galactic walled gardens on their own private planets in a winner-take-all cosmos.

Your Mad Tesla says no. The walls can come down, and a world of many new dimensions can be ours to enrich and explore. 

Get in and ride.

The economy has arrived at a point where it produces enough in principle for everyone. . . . 

So this new period we are entering is not so much about production anymore—how much is produced; it is about distribution—how people get a share in what is produced.

According to many prestigious voices, the industry is rapidly approaching a moment of “singularity.” 

Its supercomputers in the “cloud” are becoming so much more intelligent than you and command such a complete sensorium of multidimensional data streams from your brain and body that you will want these machines to take over most of the decisions in your life. 

Advanced artificial intelligence and breakthroughs in biological codes are persuading many researchers that organisms such as human beings are simply the product of an algorithm. Inscribed in DNA and neural network logic, this algorithm can be interpreted and controlled through machine learning

The cloud computing and big data of companies such as Google, with its “Deep Mind” AI, can excel individual human brains in making key life decisions from marriage choices and medical care to the management of the private key for your bitcoin wallet and the use and storage of the passwords for your Macintosh drive. 

This self-learning software will also be capable of performing most of your jobs. 

The new digital world may not need you anymore.

You do not possess the mental capability to compete with computers in such demanding applications.

Don’t worry, though. For every obsolescent homo sapiens, the leading Silicon Valley magnates recommend a federally guaranteed annual income. That’s right, “free money” every year!

You might incrementally live unemployed forever.

You may even count yourselves among the big data demiurges who ascend to become near-divinities. How about that?”

As Silicon Valley passed through the late years of the 2010s with most of its profits devolving to Google, Apple, and Facebook, however, it appeared to be undergoing a nervous breakdown, manifested on one level by delusions of omnipotence and transcendence and on another by twitchy sieges of “security” instructions on consumers’ devices

Meanwhile, it was obvious that security on the Internet had collapsed. Google dispatched “swat teams” of nerds to react to security breakdowns, which were taken for granted. 

And as Greylock Ventures’ security guru Asheem Chandna confided to Fortune, it is ultimately all your fault. Human beings readily fall for malware messages. So, says Fortune, the “fight against hacking promises to be a never-ending battle.

Back in our galaxy, how many more breaches and false promises of repair will it take before the very idea of the network will become suspect? Many industries, such as finance and insurance, have already essentially moved off-line. 

Healthcare is deep in this digital morass. Corporate assurances of safety behind firewalls and 256-bit security codes have given way to a single commandment: nothing critical goes on the Net.

The security system has broken down just as the computer elite have begun indulging the most fevered fantasies about the capabilities of their machines and issuing arrogant inanities about the comparative limits of their human customers.

In defense, Silicon Valley seems to have adopted what can best be described as a neo-Marxist political ideology and technological vision. You may wonder how I can depict as “neo-Marxists” those who on the surface seem to be the most avid and successful capitalists on the planet.

At its heart, however, the first Marxism espoused a belief that the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century solved for all time the fundamental problem of production.

The first industrial revolution, comprising steam engines, railways, electric grids, and turbines—all those “dark satanic mills”—was, according to Marx, the climactic industrial breakthrough of all time.

“Marx’s essential tenet was that in the future, the key problem of economics would become not production amid scarcity but redistribution of abundance.


Marx was typical of intellectuals in imagining that his own epoch was the final stage of human history. 

William F. Buckley used to call it an immanentized eschaton, a belief the “last things” were taking place in one’s own time.T

he neo-Marxism of today’s Silicon Valley titans repeats the error of the old Marxists in its belief that today’s technology—not steam and electricity, but silicon microchips, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing, algorithmic biology, and robotics—is the definitive human achievement. The algorithmic eschaton renders obsolete not only human labor but the human mind as well.

The algorithmic eschaton renders obsolete not only human labor but the human mind as well.

AI is believed to be redefining what it means to be human, much as Darwin’s On the Origin of Species did in its time. While Darwin made man just another animal, a precariously risen ape, Google-Marxism sees men as inferior intellectually to the company’s own algorithmic machines.

Mad Tesla makes the opposing case that what the hyperventilating haruspices Yuval Harari, Nick Bostrom, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Tim Urban, and Elon Musk see as a world-changing AI juggernaut is in fact an industrial regime at the end of its rope. The crisis of the current order in security, privacy, intellectual property, business strategy, and technology is fundamental and cannot be solved within the current computer and network architecture.

Security is the foundation of all other services and crucial to all financial transactions. It is the most basic and indispensable component of any information technology.

In business, the ability to conduct transactions is not optional. It is the way all economic learning and growth occur. If your product is “free,” it is not a product, and you are not in business, even if you can extort money from so-called advertisers to fund it.

If you do not charge for your software services—if they are “open source”—you can avoid liability for buggy “betas.” You can happily evade the overreach of the Patent Office’s ridiculous seventeen-year protection for minor software advances or “business processes,” like one-click shopping. But don’t pretend that you have customers.

Security is the most crucial part of any system. It enables the machine to possess an initial “state” or ground position and gain economic traction. If security is not integral to an information technology architecture, that architecture must be replaced.

The original distributed Internet architecture sufficed when everything was “free,” as the Internet was not a vehicle for transactions. When all it was doing was displaying Web pages, transmitting emails, running discussion forums and news groups, and hyperlinking academic sites, the Net did not absolutely need a foundation of security. 

But when the Internet became a forum for monetary transactions, new security regimes became indispensable. Credit card numbers, security codes, expiration dates, and passwords began to flood the Net.

With the ascendancy of Amazon, Apple, and other online emporia early in the twenty-first century, much of the Internet was occupied with transactions, and the industry retreated to the “cloud.” 

Abandoning the distributed Internet architecture, the leading Silicon Valley entrepreneurs replaced it with centralized and segmented subscription systems, such as Paypal, Amazon, Apple’s iTunes, Facebook, and Google cloud. Uber, Airbnb, and other sequestered “unicorns” followed. 

These so-called “walled gardens” might have sufficed if they could have actually been walled off from the rest of the Internet. 

At Apple, Steve Jobs originally attempted to accomplish such a separation by barring third-party software applications (or “apps”). 

Amazon has largely succeeded in isolating its own domains and linking to outside third parties such as credit card companies. But these centralized fortresses violated the Coase Theorem of corporate reach. 

In a famous paper, the Nobel-laureate economist Ronald Coase calculated that a business should internalize transactions only to the point that the costs of finding and contracting with outside parties exceed the inefficiencies incurred by the absence of real prices, internal markets, and economies of scale.

The concentration of data in walled gardens increases the cost of security. The industry sought safety in centralization. But centralization is not safe.

The company store was not a great advance of capitalism during the era of so-called “robber barons,” and it is no better today when it is dispersed through the cloud, funded through advertising, and combined with a spurious sharing of free goods. 

Marxism was historically hyperbolic the first time round, and the new Marxism is delusional today. It is time for a new information architecture for a globally distributed economy.

Fortunately, it is on its way.

Google and the Four Horsemen

In the Google era, Newton’s system of the world—one universe, one money, one God—is now in eclipse. 

His unitary foundation of irreversible physics and his irrefragable golden money have given way to infinite parallel universes and multiple paper moneys manipulated by fiat. 

Money, like the cosmos, has become relativistic and reversible at will.

The three hundred years of Newtonian prosperity having come to an end, the new multiverse seems unable to repeat the miracle of a golden age of capitalism. 

Slavery, in the form of servitude to governments, is making a comeback as money transactions become less trustworthy.

**Age of Mathematics will make the same claim as they have all the answers to reality, just like the empirical age.**

But the triumphs of information theory and technology had put an end to the idea of a determinist and complete mathematical system for the universe.

Mathematics in all its forms, including all its quintessential manifestations in computer software, is more treacherous than it looks.

David Hilbert. Hilbert was the renowned champion of the cause of establishing mathematics at the summit of human thought.

Hilbert had defined the challenge in 1900: to reduce all science to mathematical logic, based on deterministic mechanical principles. 

Thus it happens that our entire present-day culture, insofar as it rests on intellectual insight into and harnessing of nature, is founded on mathematics.”

**And what was mathematics founded on?** 

The mathematicians and philosophers might talk on for decades, unaware that they had been decapitated. Their successors talk on even today. But the triumphs of information theory and technology had put an end to the idea of a determinist and complete mathematical system for the universe

“Hilbert space” into a coherent mathematical rendition of quantum theory.

On the edge of the group was Kurt Gödel (contrarian), a short, shy, owl-eyed twenty-four-year-old hypochondriac.

Gödel proved that Hilbert’s, Carnap’s, and von Neumann’s most cherished mathematical goals were impossible.

Not only mathematics but all logical systems, Gödel showed in his paper—even the canonical system enshrined in the Principia Mathematica of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, even the set theory of Carnap and von Neumann—were fated to incompleteness and inconsistency.

Every logical system necessarily depends on propositions that cannot be proved within the system.

Gödel’s argument was iconoclastic. But his method of proving it was providential.

Thus in refuting the determinist philosophy behind the mathematics of Newton and the imperial logic of Hilbert, he opened the way to a new mathematics, the mathematics of information.

From this demarche emerged a new industry of computers and communications currently led by Google and informed by a new mathematics of creativity and surprise.

Gödel’s proof reads like a functional software program in which every axiom, every instruction, and every variable is couched in mathematical language suitable for computation. In proving the limits of logic, he articulated the lineaments of computing machines that would serve human masters.

Though Gödel’s proof frustrated many, von Neumann found it liberating. The limits of logic—the futility of Hilbert’s quest for a hermetically sealed universal theory—would emancipate human creators, the programmers of their machines. 

Gödel proved that axiomatizing never stops, that induction-intuition must always be present, that not all things can be proved by reason alone.

More immediately, Gödel’s proof prompted Alan Turing’s invention in 1936 of the Turing machine—the universal computing architecture with which he showed that computer programs, like other logical schemes, not only were incomplete but could not even be proved to reach any conclusion. Any particular program might cause it to churn away forever. This was the “halting problem.

Turing showed that just as the uncertainties of physics stem from using electrons and photons to measure themselves, the limitations of computers stem from recursive self-reference. Just as quantum theory fell into self-referential loops of uncertainty because it measured atoms and electrons using instruments composed of atoms and electrons, computer logic could not escape self-referential loops as its own logical structures informed its own algorithms

This lead Claude Shannon theory, conceiving the bit as the basic unit of digital computation

Shannon’s entropy is informational disorder, and the equations are the same.

Information as entropy also linked logic to the irreversible passage of time, which is also assured by the one-way passage of thermodynamic entropy 

Gödel’s work, and Turing’s, led to Gregory Chaitin’s concept of algorithmic information theory.

The universe is a hierarchy of information tiers, a universal “stack,” governed from the top down.
“Chaitin believes that the problem of computer science reflects the very successes of the modern mathematics that began with Newton. Its determinism and rigor give it supreme power in describing predictable and repeatable phenomena such as machines and systems. 

**But “life,” as he says, “is plastic, creative! How can we build this out of static, eternal, perfect mathematics? We shall use postmodern math, the mathematics that comes after Gödel, 1931, and Turing, 1936, open not closed math, the math of creativity. . . . ”**

That is the mathematics of information theory, of which Chaitin is the supreme living exponent.

Not only was a new science born but also a new economy, based on a new system of the world—the information theory articulated in 1948 by Shannon on the foundations first launched in a room in Königsberg in September 1930.

This new system of the world was consummated by the company we know as Google.

This new system of the world was consummated by the company we know as Google. 

Google, though still second in the market cap race is by far most important, paradigmatic company of our time. 

Yet I believe the Google system of the world will fail, indeed be swept away in our time (and I am seventy-eight!). It will fail because its every major premise will fail.

A system of the world necessarily combines science and commerce, religion and philosophy, economics and epistemology. It cannot merely describe or study change; it also must embody and propel change.

Google is a worthy contender to follow Newton, Gödel, and Shannon.

Under the leadership of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google developed an integrated philosophy that aspires, with growing success, to shape our lives and fortunes. 

Google has proposed a theory of knowledge and a theory of mind to animate a vision for the dominant technology of the world; a new concept of money and therefore price signals; a new morality and a new idea of the meaning and process of progress.

Upholding this theory of knowledge is a theory of mind derived from the pursuit of artificial intelligence. In this view, the brain is also fundamentally algorithmic, iteratively processing data to reach conclusions. 

Belying this notion of the brain is the study of actual brains, which turn out be much more like sensory processors than logic machines. Yet the direction of AI research is essentially unchanged.

Ultimately, the AI priesthood maintains that the human mind will be surpassed—not just in this or that specialized procedure but in all ways—by extremely fast logic machines processing unlimited data.

So the Google system of the world is embodied and enabled in a technological vision called cloud computing. If the Google theory is that universal knowledge is attained through the iterative processing of enormous amounts of data, then the data have to be somewhere accessible to the processors. 

Accessible in this case is defined by the speed of light. The speed-of-light limit—nine inches in a billionth of a second—requires the aggregation of processors and the memory in some central place, with energy available to access and process the data.

The “cloud,” then, is an artful name for the great new heavy industry of our times: gargantuan data centers composed of immense systems of data storage and processors, linked together by millions of miles of fiber-optic lines and consuming electrical power and radiating heat to an extent that excels most industrial enterprises in history.

Google’s idea of progress stems from its technological vision. Newton and his fellows, inspired by their Judeo-Christian world view, unleashed a theory of progress with human creativity and free will at its core. Google must demur. 

If the path to knowledge is the infinitely fast processing of all data, if the mind—that engine by which we pursue the truth of things—is simply a logic machine, then the combination of algorithm and data can produce one and only one result. 

Such a vision is not only deterministic but ultimately dictatorial. If there is a moral imperative to pursue the truth, and the truth can be found only by the centralized processing of all the data in the world, then all the data in the world must, by the moral order implied, be gathered into one fold with one shepherd. 

Google may talk a good game about privacy, but private data are the mortal enemy of its system of the world.

As with the gentle image of cloud computing, Google’s theory of money and prices seems at first utterly benign and even in some sense deeply Christian. 

For Google ordains that, at least within the realm under its direct control, there shall be no prices at all. With a few small (but significant) exceptions, everything Google offers to its “customers” is free. Internet searches are free. Email is free. The vast resources of the data centers, costing Google an estimated thirty billion dollars to build, are provided essentially for free.

Free is not by accident. If your business plan is to have access to the data of the entire world, then free is an imperative

So what’s wrong with free? It is always a lie, because on this earth nothing, in the end, is free. You are exchanging incommensurable items.

Of all Google’s foundational principles, the zero price, is apparently its most benign. Yet it will prove to be not only its most pernicious principle but the fatal flaw that dooms Google itself. Google will likely be an important company ten years from now. Search is a valuable service, and search it will continue to provide. On search it may prosper, even at a price of zero. But Google’s insidious system of the world will be swept away.
