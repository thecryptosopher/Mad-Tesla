If the religous & philosophical systems of ancient civilisations were so great, why aren't we practicing them?

Focus & Peripheral Awareness: Two Fundamental Sets of "Self-Knowledge"

Willed & Automatic

The automation within us is in touch with all functions in the world and is capable of manipulating them

**3 types of beings**

1. Relying on willed part for survival & progress = Western
2. Relying on Omniscient Intelligence & automations = Black Race & Orientals
3. Equillibirum of both = Ancient Egyptians 

**3 Paths**

Purification, Knowledge & Love

All fundamental skills & institutions of civilisations began with Black nations

1. Kamit [Ancient Egypt]
2. Sumer
3. Babylon
4. Elam
5. Harappa Valley
6. Kush
7. Indus Kush
8. Canaan

Because they learn from the internal path of being, they were able to intuit 6000+ years ago sciences of today

"Program of Order" is in charge of regulating the social behavious of people

Morality, wealth, spirituality & prosperity

True Reality deals with the techniques of communicating with the director of the automations within us, in order to gain access to the power, storehouse of information, and the host of shaping factors of our lives

Dominant cultures, people are directed outside themselves for moral guidance

African & some orientals direct members within themselves (trance) for intuitive guidance

Innter culture and outer culture

**The Hemispheres of the Brain**

Left is known for analytical, cartesian, serial, linear, deductive, segregative etc. outer culture

Right is known for nothing the similarites between things and their relation to each other and the whole thus unifying them, generally known as synthetical, holistic & congregative. inner culture

Hemispheric differences are not randomly distributed through society

White People are generally left brain and Black otherwise

Cerebral differences in thought patterns between white & black races are well known

Meaning of religion: Tieing people back. to something with which they had originally been one and belong with by natural connectivity

**Religion, Trance & Ancestors**

1. the dead (ancestors)
2. Spirits administrating natural phenomena becomes possible


Inner emperical evidence for the immortality of Man

Survival of spirit and one's identity across incarnations
