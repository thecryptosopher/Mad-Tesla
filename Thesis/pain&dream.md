## Life After Google Before

Like the earth, the Universe is not flat. Meager and deterministic theories that see the universe as shear matter, ruled by physics and chemistry alone, leave no room for human consciousness and creativity. Just as a 3D ride-film transcends a 2D movie, other dimensions of experience are transformative and artistically real.

As Harvard mathematician-philosopher C. S. Peirce explained early in the last century, all symbols and their objects, whether in software, language, or art, require the mediation of an interpretive mind

From our minds open potential metaverses, infinite dimensions of imaginative reality—counter-factuals, analogies, interpretive emotions, flights of thought and creativity. 

The Internet has not delivered on some of its most important promises. 

Under Google’s guidance, the Internet is not only full of unwanted ads but fraught with bots and malware. Instead of putting power in the hands of individuals, it has become a porous cloud where all the money and power rise to the top.

On a deeper level, the world of Google—its interfaces, its images, its videos, its icons, its philosophy—is 2D. Google is not just a company but a system of the world. And the Internet is cracking under the weight of this ideology. Its devotees uphold the flat-universe theory of materialism: the sufficiency of deterministic chemistry and mathematics. They believe the human mind is a suboptimal product of random evolutionary processes. They believe in the possibility of a silicon brain. They believe that machines can “learn” in a way comparable to human learning, that consciousness is a relatively insignificant aspect of humanity, emergent from matter, and that imagination of true novelties is a delusion in a hermetic world of logic. They hold that human beings have no more to discover and may as well retire on a guaranteed pension, while Larry Page and Sergey Brin fly off with Elon Musk and live forever in galactic walled gardens on their own private planets in a winner-take-all cosmos.
Your DeLorean says no. The walls can come down, and a world of many new dimensions can be ours to enrich and explore. Get in and ride.

According to many prestigious voices, the industry is rapidly approaching a moment of “singularity.” Its supercomputers in the “cloud” are becoming so much more intelligent than you and command such a complete sensorium of multidimensional data streams from your brain and body that you will want these machines to take over most of the decisions in your life.

The cloud computing and big data of companies such as Google, with its “Deep Mind” AI, can excel individual human brains in making key life decisions from marriage choices and medical care to the management of the private key for your bitcoin wallet and the use and storage of the passwords for your Macintosh drive. This self-learning software will also be capable of performing most of your jobs. The new digital world may not need you anymore.

Don’t take offense. In all likelihood, you can retire on an income which we regard as satisfactory for you.

Leading Silicon Valley employers, such as Larry Page, Elon Musk, Sergey Brin, and Tim Cook, deem most human beings unemployable because they are intellectually inferior to AI algorithms.

Don’t worry, though. For every obsolescent homo sapiens, the leading Silicon Valley magnates recommend a federally guaranteed annual income. 

You may even count yourselves among the big data demiurges who ascend to become near-divinities. How about that?

As Google Search becomes virtually omniscient, commanding powers that previous human tribes ascribed to the gods, you may become a homo deus. A favored speaker on the Google campus, Yuval Noah Harari

As Silicon Valley passed through the late years of the 2010s with most of its profits devolving to Google, Apple, and Facebook, however, it appeared to be undergoing a nervous breakdown, manifested on one level by delusions of omnipotence and transcendence and on another by twitchy sieges of “security” instructions on consumers’ devices.


**Ch.1 Dont Steal This Book**

**Summary**: ....



Meanwhile, it was obvious that security on the Internet had collapsed.

**Many industries, such as finance and insurance, have already essentially moved off-line. Healthcare is deep in this digital morass. Corporate assurances of safety behind firewalls and 256-bit security codes have given way to a single commandment: nothing critical goes on the Net.**

The security system has broken down just as the computer elite have begun indulging the most fevered fantasies about the capabilities of their machines and issuing arrogant inanities about the comparative limits of their human customers. 

Meanwhile, these delusions of omnipotence have not prevented the eclipse of its initial public offering market, the antitrust tribulations of its champion companies led by Google, and the profitless prosperity of its hungry herds of “unicorns,” as they call private companies worth more than one billion dollars. Capping these setbacks is Silicon Valley’s loss of entrepreneurial edge in IPOs and increasingly in venture capital to nominal communists in China.

**In defense, Silicon Valley seems to have adopted what can best be described as a neo-Marxist political ideology and technological vision.**

At its heart, however, the first Marxism espoused a belief that the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century solved for all time the fundamental problem of production.

Marx’s essential tenet was that in the future, the key problem of economics would become not production amid scarcity but redistribution of abundance.

Marx was typical of intellectuals in imagining that his own epoch was the final stage of human history. William F. Buckley used to call it an immanentized eschaton, a belief the “last things” were taking place in one’s own time.

The neo- Marxism of today’s Silicon Valley titans repeats the error of the old Marxists in its belief that today’s technology—not steam and electricity, but silicon microchips, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing, algorithmic biology, and robotics—is the definitive human achievement.

The algorithmic eschaton renders obsolete not only human labor but the human mind as well.

Strangely enough, this delusion is shared by Silicon Valley’s critics. The dystopians join the utopians in imagining a supremely competent and visionary Silicon Valley, led by Google with its monopoly of information and intelligence.

AI is believed to be redefining what it means to be human

While Darwin made man just another animal, a precariously risen ape, Google-Marxism sees men as inferior intellectually to the company’s own algorithmic machines.

Life after Google makes the opposing case that what the hyperventilating haruspices Yuval Harari, Nick Bostrom, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Tim Urban, and Elon Musk see as a world-changing AI juggernaut is in fact an industrial regime at the end of its rope. The crisis of the current order in security, privacy, intellectual property, business strategy, and technology is fundamental and cannot be solved within the current computer and network architecture.

**Security is not a function of the system but the foundation of all other services and crucial to all financial transactions. It is the most basic and indispensable component of any information technology**

In business, the ability to conduct transactions is not optional. It is the way all economic learning and growth occur. If your product is **free**, it is not a product, and you are not in business, even if you can extort money from so- called advertisers to fund it.**

**If you do not charge for your software services—if they are “open source”— you can avoid liability for buggy “betas.”

Security is the most crucial part of any system. It enables the machine to possess an initial “state” or ground position and gain economic traction. If security is not integral to an information technology architecture, that architecture must be replaced.

The original distributed Internet architecture sufficed when everything was “free,” as the Internet was not a vehicle for transactions. When all it was doing was displaying Web pages, transmitting emails, running discussion forums and news groups, and hyperlinking academic sites, the Net did not absolutely need a foundation of security.

But when the Internet became a forum for monetary transactions, new security regimes became indispensable.

With the ascendancy of Amazon, Apple, and other online emporia early in the twenty-first century, much of the Internet was occupied with transactions, and the industry retreated to the “cloud.” Abandoning the distributed Internet architecture, the leading Silicon Valley entrepreneurs replaced it with centralized and segmented subscription systems, such as Paypal, Amazon, Apple’s iTunes, Facebook, and Google cloud. Uber, Airbnb, and other sequestered “unicorns” followed.

But these centralized fortresses violated the Coase Theorem of corporate reach. In a famous paper, the Nobel-laureate economist Ronald Coase calculated that a business should internalize transactions only to the point that the costs of finding and contracting with outside parties exceed the inefficiencies incurred by the absence of real prices, internal markets, and economies of scale

The concentration of data in walled gardens increases the cost of security. The industry sought safety in centralization. But centralization is not safe.

The company store was not a great advance of capitalism during the era of so- called “robber barons,” and it is no better today when it is dispersed through the cloud, funded through advertising, and combined with a spurious sharing of free goods. Marxism was historically hyperbolic the first time round, and the new Marxism is delusional today. It is time for a new information architecture for a globally distributed economy.
Fortunately, it is on its way.


**Ch.2 Google's System of the World**

**Summary**: Development of information theory that led to the new system of the world, developed by Godel-Shannon-Turing, consummate by Google ....

Google, alone among the five, is the protagonist of a new and apparently successful “system of the world.”

That phrase, “system of the world,” denotes a set of ideas that pervade a society’s technology and institutions and inform its civilization.1

Since **Claude Shannon** in 1948 and Peter Drucker in the 1950s, we have all spoken of the information economy as if it were a new idea. But both Newton’s physics and his gold standard were information systems. More specifically, the Newtonian system is what we call today an information theory.

All wealth is the product of knowledge. Matter is conserved; progress consists of learning how to use it

Newton’s regime rendered money essentially as irreversible as gold, as irreversible as time itself.

Perhaps the most important result of free commerce was the end of slavery. Reliable money and free and efficient labor markets made ownership of human laborers unprofitable. Commerce eclipsed physical power.

In the Google era, Newton’s system of the world—one universe, one money, one God—is now in eclipse. His unitary foundation of irreversible physics and his irrefragable golden money have given way to infinite parallel universes and multiple paper moneys manipulated by fiat. Money, like the cosmos, has become relativistic and reversible at will.

The three hundred years of Newtonian prosperity having come to an end, the new multiverse seems unable to repeat the miracle of a golden age of capitalism. It is now widely held that citizens are essentially owned by the state on which they depend. Slavery, in the form of servitude to governments, is making a comeback as money transactions become less trustworthy.

Fortunately the lineaments of a new system of the world have emerged. It could be said to have been born in early September 1930

Hilbert was the renowned champion of the cause of establishing mathematics at the summit of human thought.

Hilbert had defined the challenge in 1900: to reduce all science to mathematical logic, based on deterministic mechanical principles.

“The instrument that mediates between theory and practice, between thought and observation, is mathematics; it builds the connecting bridge and makes it stronger and stronger. Thus it happens that our entire present-day culture, insofar as it rests on intellectual insight into and harnessing of nature, is founded on mathematics.”

And what was mathematics founded on?

Responding to the Latin maxim ignoramus et ignorabimus (“we do not know and will not know”), Hilbert declared: “For us [mathematicians] there is no ignorabimus, and in my opinion none whatever in natural science. In opposition to the foolish ignorabimus our slogan shall be: ‘We must know, we will know’ ”—Wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen—a declaration that was inscribed on his tombstone.7

After the pre-conference ended, however, everyone might as well have gone home. A new system of the world, entirely incompatible with Hilbert’s determinist vision, had been launched.

But the triumphs of information theory and technology had put an end to the idea of a determinist and complete mathematical system for the universe.

von Neumann had written seven major papers in the cause. In 1932, he would complete work to extend “Hilbert space” into a coherent mathematical rendition of quantum theory.

Emerging as the grim reaper at the party of twentieth-century triumphalism, however, Gödel proved that Hilbert’s, Carnap’s, and von Neumann’s most cherished mathematical goals were impossible.

Not only mathematics but all logical systems, Gödel showed in his paper—even the canonical system enshrined in the Principia Mathematica of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, even the set theory of Carnap and von Neumann—were fated to incompleteness and inconsistency.

They necessarily harbored paradoxes and aporias. Mere consistency of a formal system offered no assurance that what the system proved was correct. Every logical system necessarily depends on propositions that cannot be proved within the system.

Gödel’s argument was iconoclastic. But his method of proving it was providential. He devised a set of algorithms in which all the symbols and instructions were numbers. Thus in refuting the determinist philosophy behind the mathematics of Newton and the imperial logic of Hilbert, he opened the way to a new mathematics, the mathematics of information.8 From this demarche emerged a new industry of computers and communications currently led by Google and informed by a new mathematics of creativity and surprise.

Gödel’s proof reads like a functional software program in which every axiom, every instruction, and every variable is couched in mathematical language suitable for computation. In proving the limits of logic, he articulated the lineaments of computing machines that would serve human masters.

The limits of logic—the futility of Hilbert’s quest for a hermetically sealed universal theory—would emancipate human creators, the programmers of their machines. 

“Gödel proved that axiomatizing never stops, that induction-intuition must always be present, that not all things can be proved by reason alone.”

The new vision ultimately led to a new information theory of biology, anticipated in principle by von Neumann and developed most fully by Hubert Yockey,10 in which human beings might eventually reprogram parts of their own DNA.

More immediately, Gödel’s proof prompted Alan Turing’s invention in 1936 of the Turing machine—the universal computing architecture with which he showed that computer programs, like other logical schemes, not only were incomplete but could not even be proved to reach any conclusion. Any particular program might cause it to churn away forever. 

This was the “halting problem.” Computers required what Turing called “oracles” to give them instructions and judge their outputs.11

Turing showed that just as the uncertainties of physics stem from using electrons and photons to measure themselves, the limitations of computers stem from recursive self-reference.

Just as quantum theory fell into self-referential loops of uncertainty because it measured atoms and electrons using instruments composed of atoms and electrons, computer logic could not escape self- referential loops as its own logical structures informed its own algorithms.

Gödel’s insights led directly to Claude Shannon’s information theory, which underlies all computers and networks today. Conceiving the bit as the basic unit of digital computation, Shannon defined information as surprising bits—that is, bits not predetermined by the machine. Information became the contents of Turing-oracular messages—unexpected bits—not entailed by the hermetic logic of the machine itself.

Shannon’s canonical equation translated Ludwig Boltzmann’s analog entropy into digital terms.

Boltzmann’s entropy is thermodynamic disorder; Shannon’s entropy is informational disorder, and the equations are the same.

Using his entropy index of surprisal as the gauge of information, This tool made possible the development of dependable software for vast computer systems and networks such as the Internet.

Information as entropy also linked logic to the irreversible passage of time, which is also assured by the one-way passage of thermodynamic entropy.

Gödel’s work, and Turing’s, led to Gregory Chaitin’s concept of algorithmic information theory

The universe is a hierarchy of information tiers, a universal “stack,” governed from the top down.

Chaitin believes that the problem of computer science reflects the very successes of the modern mathematics that began with Newton. Its determinism and rigor give it supreme power in describing predictable and repeatable phenomena such as machines and systems. But “life,” as he says, “is plastic, creative! How can we build this out of static, eternal, perfect mathematics? 

We shall use postmodern math, the mathematics that comes after Gödel, 1931, and Turing, 1936, open not closed math, the math of creativity. . . . ”13 That is the mathematics of information theory, of which Chaitin is the supreme living exponent.

Cleaving all information is the great divide between creativity and determinism, between information entropy of surprise and thermodynamic entropy of predictable decline, between stories that capture a particular truth and statistics that reveal a sterile generality, between cryptographic hashes that preserve information and mathematical blends that dissolve it, between the butterfly effect and the law of averages, between genetics and the law of large numbers, between singularities and big data

—in a word, the impassible gulf between consciousness and machines.

Not only was a new science born but also a new economy, based on a new system of the world—the information theory articulated in 1948 by Shannon

This new system of the world was consummated by the company we know as Google. Google, though still second in the market cap race is by far most important, paradigmatic company of our time. Yet I believe the Google system of the world will fail, indeed be swept away in our time (and I am seventy-eight!). It will fail because its every major premise will fail.

A system of the world necessarily combines science and commerce, religion and philosophy, economics and epistemology. It cannot merely describe or study change; it also must embody and propel change.

Google is a worthy contender to follow Newton, Gödel, and Shannon. It is the first company in history to develop and carry out a system of the world. 

Google has proposed a theory of knowledge and a theory of mind to animate a vision for the dominant technology of the world; a new concept of money and therefore price signals; a new morality and a new idea of the meaning and process of progress

The Google theory of knowledge, nicknamed “big data,” is as radical as Newton’s and as intimidating as Newton’s was liberating.

“Big data” takes just the opposite approach. The idea of big data is that the previous slow, clumsy, step-by-step search for knowledge by human brains can be replaced if two conditions are met: All the data in the world can be compiled in a single “place,” and algorithms sufficiently comprehensive to analyze them can be written.

Upholding this theory of knowledge is a theory of mind derived from the pursuit of artificial intelligence.

 In this view, the brain is also fundamentally algorithmic, iteratively processing data to reach conclusions. Belying this notion of the brain is the study of actual brains, which turn out be much more like sensory processors than logic machines.
 
 Therefore, most efforts to duplicate human intelligence remain exercises in faster and faster processing of the sort computers handle well. Ultimately, the AI priesthood maintains that the human mind will be surpassed
 
 The Google theory of knowledge and mind are not mere abstract exercises. They dictate Google’s business model, which has progressed from “search” to “satisfy.”
 
  the Google system of the world is embodied and enabled in a technological vision called cloud computing. If the Google theory is that universal knowledge is attained through the iterative processing of enormous amounts of data, then the data have to be somewhere accessible to the processors. Accessible in this case is defined by the speed of light.
  
  Accessible in this case is defined by the speed of light. The speed-of- light limit—nine inches in a billionth of a second—requires the aggregation of processors and the memory in some central place, with energy available to access and process the data.
  
  The “cloud,” then, is an artful name for the great new heavy industry of our times: gargantuan data centers composed of immense systems of data storage and processors, linked together by millions of miles of fiber-optic lines and consuming electrical power and radiating heat to an extent that excels most industrial enterprises in history.
  
  If the path to knowledge is the infinitely fast processing of all data, if the mind— that engine by which we pursue the truth of things—is simply a logic machine, then the combination of algorithm and data can produce one and only one result. Such a vision is not only deterministic but ultimately dictatorial. 
  
  If there is a moral imperative to pursue the truth, and the truth can be found only by the centralized processing of all the data in the world, then all the data in the world must, by the moral order implied, be gathered into one fold with one shepherd.
  
  Google may talk a good game about privacy, but private data are the mortal enemy of its system of the world.
  
  As with the gentle image of cloud computing, Google’s theory of money and prices seems at first utterly benign and even in some sense deeply Christian.
  
  For Google ordains that, at least within the realm under its direct control, there shall be no prices at all. 
  
  So what’s wrong with free? It is always a lie, because on this earth nothing, in the end, is free. You are exchanging incommensurable items.
  
  If you do not charge for your software services—if they are “open source”— you can avoid liability for buggy “betas”.
  
  Of all Google’s foundational principles, the zero price, is apparently its most benign. Yet it will prove to be not only its most pernicious principle but the fatal flaw that dooms Google itself. Google will likely be an important company ten years from now. Search is a valuable service, and search it will continue to provide. On search it may prosper, even at a price of zero. 
  
  But Google’s insidious system of the world will be swept away.
