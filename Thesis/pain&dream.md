## Life After Google Before

Like the earth, the Universe is not flat. Meager and deterministic theories that see the universe as shear matter, ruled by physics and chemistry alone, leave no room for human consciousness and creativity. Just as a 3D ride-film transcends a 2D movie, other dimensions of experience are transformative and artistically real.

As Harvard mathematician-philosopher C. S. Peirce explained early in the last century, all symbols and their objects, whether in software, language, or art, require the mediation of an interpretive mind

From our minds open potential metaverses, infinite dimensions of imaginative reality—counter-factuals, analogies, interpretive emotions, flights of thought and creativity. 

The Internet has not delivered on some of its most important promises. 

Under Google’s guidance, the Internet is not only full of unwanted ads but fraught with bots and malware. Instead of putting power in the hands of individuals, it has become a porous cloud where all the money and power rise to the top.

On a deeper level, the world of Google—its interfaces, its images, its videos, its icons, its philosophy—is 2D. Google is not just a company but a system of the world. And the Internet is cracking under the weight of this ideology. Its devotees uphold the flat-universe theory of materialism: the sufficiency of deterministic chemistry and mathematics. They believe the human mind is a suboptimal product of random evolutionary processes. They believe in the possibility of a silicon brain. They believe that machines can “learn” in a way comparable to human learning, that consciousness is a relatively insignificant aspect of humanity, emergent from matter, and that imagination of true novelties is a delusion in a hermetic world of logic. They hold that human beings have no more to discover and may as well retire on a guaranteed pension, while Larry Page and Sergey Brin fly off with Elon Musk and live forever in galactic walled gardens on their own private planets in a winner-take-all cosmos.
Your DeLorean says no. The walls can come down, and a world of many new dimensions can be ours to enrich and explore. Get in and ride.

According to many prestigious voices, the industry is rapidly approaching a moment of “singularity.” Its supercomputers in the “cloud” are becoming so much more intelligent than you and command such a complete sensorium of multidimensional data streams from your brain and body that you will want these machines to take over most of the decisions in your life.

The cloud computing and big data of companies such as Google, with its “Deep Mind” AI, can excel individual human brains in making key life decisions from marriage choices and medical care to the management of the private key for your bitcoin wallet and the use and storage of the passwords for your Macintosh drive. This self-learning software will also be capable of performing most of your jobs. The new digital world may not need you anymore.

Don’t take offense. In all likelihood, you can retire on an income which we regard as satisfactory for you.

Leading Silicon Valley employers, such as Larry Page, Elon Musk, Sergey Brin, and Tim Cook, deem most human beings unemployable because they are intellectually inferior to AI algorithms.

Don’t worry, though. For every obsolescent homo sapiens, the leading Silicon Valley magnates recommend a federally guaranteed annual income. 

You may even count yourselves among the big data demiurges who ascend to become near-divinities. How about that?

As Google Search becomes virtually omniscient, commanding powers that previous human tribes ascribed to the gods, you may become a homo deus. A favored speaker on the Google campus, Yuval Noah Harari

As Silicon Valley passed through the late years of the 2010s with most of its profits devolving to Google, Apple, and Facebook, however, it appeared to be undergoing a nervous breakdown, manifested on one level by delusions of omnipotence and transcendence and on another by twitchy sieges of “security” instructions on consumers’ devices.


**Ch.1 Dont Steal This Book**

**Summary**: ....



Meanwhile, it was obvious that security on the Internet had collapsed.

**Many industries, such as finance and insurance, have already essentially moved off-line. Healthcare is deep in this digital morass. Corporate assurances of safety behind firewalls and 256-bit security codes have given way to a single commandment: nothing critical goes on the Net.**

The security system has broken down just as the computer elite have begun indulging the most fevered fantasies about the capabilities of their machines and issuing arrogant inanities about the comparative limits of their human customers. 

Meanwhile, these delusions of omnipotence have not prevented the eclipse of its initial public offering market, the antitrust tribulations of its champion companies led by Google, and the profitless prosperity of its hungry herds of “unicorns,” as they call private companies worth more than one billion dollars. Capping these setbacks is Silicon Valley’s loss of entrepreneurial edge in IPOs and increasingly in venture capital to nominal communists in China.

**In defense, Silicon Valley seems to have adopted what can best be described as a neo-Marxist political ideology and technological vision.**

At its heart, however, the first Marxism espoused a belief that the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century solved for all time the fundamental problem of production.

Marx’s essential tenet was that in the future, the key problem of economics would become not production amid scarcity but redistribution of abundance.

Marx was typical of intellectuals in imagining that his own epoch was the final stage of human history. William F. Buckley used to call it an immanentized eschaton, a belief the “last things” were taking place in one’s own time.

The neo- Marxism of today’s Silicon Valley titans repeats the error of the old Marxists in its belief that today’s technology—not steam and electricity, but silicon microchips, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing, algorithmic biology, and robotics—is the definitive human achievement.

The algorithmic eschaton renders obsolete not only human labor but the human mind as well.

Strangely enough, this delusion is shared by Silicon Valley’s critics. The dystopians join the utopians in imagining a supremely competent and visionary Silicon Valley, led by Google with its monopoly of information and intelligence.

AI is believed to be redefining what it means to be human

While Darwin made man just another animal, a precariously risen ape, Google-Marxism sees men as inferior intellectually to the company’s own algorithmic machines.

Life after Google makes the opposing case that what the hyperventilating haruspices Yuval Harari, Nick Bostrom, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Tim Urban, and Elon Musk see as a world-changing AI juggernaut is in fact an industrial regime at the end of its rope. The crisis of the current order in security, privacy, intellectual property, business strategy, and technology is fundamental and cannot be solved within the current computer and network architecture.

**Security is not a function of the system but the foundation of all other services and crucial to all financial transactions. It is the most basic and indispensable component of any information technology**

In business, the ability to conduct transactions is not optional. It is the way all economic learning and growth occur. If your product is **free**, it is not a product, and you are not in business, even if you can extort money from so- called advertisers to fund it.**

**If you do not charge for your software services—if they are “open source”— you can avoid liability for buggy “betas.”

Security is the most crucial part of any system. It enables the machine to possess an initial “state” or ground position and gain economic traction. If security is not integral to an information technology architecture, that architecture must be replaced.

The original distributed Internet architecture sufficed when everything was “free,” as the Internet was not a vehicle for transactions. When all it was doing was displaying Web pages, transmitting emails, running discussion forums and news groups, and hyperlinking academic sites, the Net did not absolutely need a foundation of security.

But when the Internet became a forum for monetary transactions, new security regimes became indispensable.

With the ascendancy of Amazon, Apple, and other online emporia early in the twenty-first century, much of the Internet was occupied with transactions, and the industry retreated to the “cloud.” Abandoning the distributed Internet architecture, the leading Silicon Valley entrepreneurs replaced it with centralized and segmented subscription systems, such as Paypal, Amazon, Apple’s iTunes, Facebook, and Google cloud. Uber, Airbnb, and other sequestered “unicorns” followed.

But these centralized fortresses violated the Coase Theorem of corporate reach. In a famous paper, the Nobel-laureate economist Ronald Coase calculated that a business should internalize transactions only to the point that the costs of finding and contracting with outside parties exceed the inefficiencies incurred by the absence of real prices, internal markets, and economies of scale

The concentration of data in walled gardens increases the cost of security. The industry sought safety in centralization. But centralization is not safe.

The company store was not a great advance of capitalism during the era of so- called “robber barons,” and it is no better today when it is dispersed through the cloud, funded through advertising, and combined with a spurious sharing of free goods. Marxism was historically hyperbolic the first time round, and the new Marxism is delusional today. It is time for a new information architecture for a globally distributed economy.
Fortunately, it is on its way.


**Ch.2 Google's System of the World**

**Summary**: Development of information theory that led to the new system of the world, developed by Godel-Shannon-Turing, consummate by Google ....

Google, alone among the five, is the protagonist of a new and apparently successful “system of the world.”

That phrase, “system of the world,” denotes a set of ideas that pervade a society’s technology and institutions and inform its civilization.1

Since **Claude Shannon** in 1948 and Peter Drucker in the 1950s, we have all spoken of the information economy as if it were a new idea. But both Newton’s physics and his gold standard were information systems. More specifically, the Newtonian system is what we call today an information theory.

All wealth is the product of knowledge. Matter is conserved; progress consists of learning how to use it

Newton’s regime rendered money essentially as irreversible as gold, as irreversible as time itself.

Perhaps the most important result of free commerce was the end of slavery. Reliable money and free and efficient labor markets made ownership of human laborers unprofitable. Commerce eclipsed physical power.

In the Google era, Newton’s system of the world—one universe, one money, one God—is now in eclipse. His unitary foundation of irreversible physics and his irrefragable golden money have given way to infinite parallel universes and multiple paper moneys manipulated by fiat. Money, like the cosmos, has become relativistic and reversible at will.

The three hundred years of Newtonian prosperity having come to an end, the new multiverse seems unable to repeat the miracle of a golden age of capitalism. It is now widely held that citizens are essentially owned by the state on which they depend. Slavery, in the form of servitude to governments, is making a comeback as money transactions become less trustworthy.

Fortunately the lineaments of a new system of the world have emerged. It could be said to have been born in early September 1930

Hilbert was the renowned champion of the cause of establishing mathematics at the summit of human thought.

Hilbert had defined the challenge in 1900: to reduce all science to mathematical logic, based on deterministic mechanical principles.

“The instrument that mediates between theory and practice, between thought and observation, is mathematics; it builds the connecting bridge and makes it stronger and stronger. Thus it happens that our entire present-day culture, insofar as it rests on intellectual insight into and harnessing of nature, is founded on mathematics.”

And what was mathematics founded on?

Responding to the Latin maxim ignoramus et ignorabimus (“we do not know and will not know”), Hilbert declared: “For us [mathematicians] there is no ignorabimus, and in my opinion none whatever in natural science. In opposition to the foolish ignorabimus our slogan shall be: ‘We must know, we will know’ ”—Wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen—a declaration that was inscribed on his tombstone.7

After the pre-conference ended, however, everyone might as well have gone home. A new system of the world, entirely incompatible with Hilbert’s determinist vision, had been launched.

But the triumphs of information theory and technology had put an end to the idea of a determinist and complete mathematical system for the universe.

von Neumann had written seven major papers in the cause. In 1932, he would complete work to extend “Hilbert space” into a coherent mathematical rendition of quantum theory.

Emerging as the grim reaper at the party of twentieth-century triumphalism, however, Gödel proved that Hilbert’s, Carnap’s, and von Neumann’s most cherished mathematical goals were impossible.

Not only mathematics but all logical systems, Gödel showed in his paper—even the canonical system enshrined in the Principia Mathematica of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, even the set theory of Carnap and von Neumann—were fated to incompleteness and inconsistency.

They necessarily harbored paradoxes and aporias. Mere consistency of a formal system offered no assurance that what the system proved was correct. Every logical system necessarily depends on propositions that cannot be proved within the system.

Gödel’s argument was iconoclastic. But his method of proving it was providential. He devised a set of algorithms in which all the symbols and instructions were numbers. Thus in refuting the determinist philosophy behind the mathematics of Newton and the imperial logic of Hilbert, he opened the way to a new mathematics, the mathematics of information.8 From this demarche emerged a new industry of computers and communications currently led by Google and informed by a new mathematics of creativity and surprise.

Gödel’s proof reads like a functional software program in which every axiom, every instruction, and every variable is couched in mathematical language suitable for computation. In proving the limits of logic, he articulated the lineaments of computing machines that would serve human masters.

The limits of logic—the futility of Hilbert’s quest for a hermetically sealed universal theory—would emancipate human creators, the programmers of their machines. 

“Gödel proved that axiomatizing never stops, that induction-intuition must always be present, that not all things can be proved by reason alone.”

The new vision ultimately led to a new information theory of biology, anticipated in principle by von Neumann and developed most fully by Hubert Yockey,10 in which human beings might eventually reprogram parts of their own DNA.

More immediately, Gödel’s proof prompted Alan Turing’s invention in 1936 of the Turing machine—the universal computing architecture with which he showed that computer programs, like other logical schemes, not only were incomplete but could not even be proved to reach any conclusion. Any particular program might cause it to churn away forever. 

This was the “halting problem.” Computers required what Turing called “oracles” to give them instructions and judge their outputs.11

Turing showed that just as the uncertainties of physics stem from using electrons and photons to measure themselves, the limitations of computers stem from recursive self-reference.

Just as quantum theory fell into self-referential loops of uncertainty because it measured atoms and electrons using instruments composed of atoms and electrons, computer logic could not escape self- referential loops as its own logical structures informed its own algorithms.

Gödel’s insights led directly to Claude Shannon’s information theory, which underlies all computers and networks today. Conceiving the bit as the basic unit of digital computation, Shannon defined information as surprising bits—that is, bits not predetermined by the machine. Information became the contents of Turing-oracular messages—unexpected bits—not entailed by the hermetic logic of the machine itself.

Shannon’s canonical equation translated Ludwig Boltzmann’s analog entropy into digital terms.

Boltzmann’s entropy is thermodynamic disorder; Shannon’s entropy is informational disorder, and the equations are the same.

Using his entropy index of surprisal as the gauge of information, This tool made possible the development of dependable software for vast computer systems and networks such as the Internet.

Information as entropy also linked logic to the irreversible passage of time, which is also assured by the one-way passage of thermodynamic entropy.

Gödel’s work, and Turing’s, led to Gregory Chaitin’s concept of algorithmic information theory

The universe is a hierarchy of information tiers, a universal “stack,” governed from the top down.

Chaitin believes that the problem of computer science reflects the very successes of the modern mathematics that began with Newton. Its determinism and rigor give it supreme power in describing predictable and repeatable phenomena such as machines and systems. But “life,” as he says, “is plastic, creative! How can we build this out of static, eternal, perfect mathematics? 

We shall use postmodern math, the mathematics that comes after Gödel, 1931, and Turing, 1936, open not closed math, the math of creativity. . . . ”13 That is the mathematics of information theory, of which Chaitin is the supreme living exponent.

Cleaving all information is the great divide between creativity and determinism, between information entropy of surprise and thermodynamic entropy of predictable decline, between stories that capture a particular truth and statistics that reveal a sterile generality, between cryptographic hashes that preserve information and mathematical blends that dissolve it, between the butterfly effect and the law of averages, between genetics and the law of large numbers, between singularities and big data

—in a word, the impassible gulf between consciousness and machines.

Not only was a new science born but also a new economy, based on a new system of the world—the information theory articulated in 1948 by Shannon

This new system of the world was consummated by the company we know as Google. Google, though still second in the market cap race is by far most important, paradigmatic company of our time. Yet I believe the Google system of the world will fail, indeed be swept away in our time (and I am seventy-eight!). It will fail because its every major premise will fail.

A system of the world necessarily combines science and commerce, religion and philosophy, economics and epistemology. It cannot merely describe or study change; it also must embody and propel change.

Google is a worthy contender to follow Newton, Gödel, and Shannon. It is the first company in history to develop and carry out a system of the world. 

Google has proposed a theory of knowledge and a theory of mind to animate a vision for the dominant technology of the world; a new concept of money and therefore price signals; a new morality and a new idea of the meaning and process of progress

The Google theory of knowledge, nicknamed “big data,” is as radical as Newton’s and as intimidating as Newton’s was liberating.

“Big data” takes just the opposite approach. The idea of big data is that the previous slow, clumsy, step-by-step search for knowledge by human brains can be replaced if two conditions are met: All the data in the world can be compiled in a single “place,” and algorithms sufficiently comprehensive to analyze them can be written.

Upholding this theory of knowledge is a theory of mind derived from the pursuit of artificial intelligence.

 In this view, the brain is also fundamentally algorithmic, iteratively processing data to reach conclusions. Belying this notion of the brain is the study of actual brains, which turn out be much more like sensory processors than logic machines.
 
 Therefore, most efforts to duplicate human intelligence remain exercises in faster and faster processing of the sort computers handle well. Ultimately, the AI priesthood maintains that the human mind will be surpassed
 
 The Google theory of knowledge and mind are not mere abstract exercises. They dictate Google’s business model, which has progressed from “search” to “satisfy.”
 
  the Google system of the world is embodied and enabled in a technological vision called cloud computing. If the Google theory is that universal knowledge is attained through the iterative processing of enormous amounts of data, then the data have to be somewhere accessible to the processors. Accessible in this case is defined by the speed of light.
  
  Accessible in this case is defined by the speed of light. The speed-of- light limit—nine inches in a billionth of a second—requires the aggregation of processors and the memory in some central place, with energy available to access and process the data.
  
  The “cloud,” then, is an artful name for the great new heavy industry of our times: gargantuan data centers composed of immense systems of data storage and processors, linked together by millions of miles of fiber-optic lines and consuming electrical power and radiating heat to an extent that excels most industrial enterprises in history.
  
  If the path to knowledge is the infinitely fast processing of all data, if the mind— that engine by which we pursue the truth of things—is simply a logic machine, then the combination of algorithm and data can produce one and only one result. Such a vision is not only deterministic but ultimately dictatorial. 
  
  If there is a moral imperative to pursue the truth, and the truth can be found only by the centralized processing of all the data in the world, then all the data in the world must, by the moral order implied, be gathered into one fold with one shepherd.
  
  Google may talk a good game about privacy, but private data are the mortal enemy of its system of the world.
  
  As with the gentle image of cloud computing, Google’s theory of money and prices seems at first utterly benign and even in some sense deeply Christian.
  
  For Google ordains that, at least within the realm under its direct control, there shall be no prices at all. 
  
  So what’s wrong with free? It is always a lie, because on this earth nothing, in the end, is free. You are exchanging incommensurable items.
  
  If you do not charge for your software services—if they are “open source”— you can avoid liability for buggy “betas”.
  
  Of all Google’s foundational principles, the zero price, is apparently its most benign. Yet it will prove to be not only its most pernicious principle but the fatal flaw that dooms Google itself. Google will likely be an important company ten years from now. Search is a valuable service, and search it will continue to provide. On search it may prosper, even at a price of zero. 
  
  But Google’s insidious system of the world will be swept away.
  
  **Ch.3 Google's Roots & Religions**

**Summary**: Google's integrated philopsophy
  
Under the leadership of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google developed the integrated philosophy that currently shapes our lives and fortunes, combining 

1) A theory of knowledge (nicknamed “Big Data”)
2) A technological vision (centralized cloud computing)
3) A cult of the commons (rooted in “open source” software)
4) A concept of money and value (based on free goods and automated advertising)
5) A theory of morality as “gifts” rather than profits
6) A view of progress as evolutionary inevitability
7) An ever diminishing “carbon footprint.

Kurzweil calls it a “singularity,” marked by the triumph of computation over human intelligence.

Google was never just a computer or software company. 

Google’s founders always conceived of their projects in prophetic terms.

Brin supplied the mathematical wizardry that converted the PageRank search algorithm into a scalable “crawler” across the entire expanse of the Internet and beyond.

Page and Brin set out to render the world, beginning with its simulacrum, the Worldwide Web, as a readable set of digital files, a “corpus” of accessible information, an enormous database.

As Page put it, “We don’t always produce what people want; it’s really difficult. To do that you have to be smart—you have to understand everything in the world. In computer science, we call that artificial intelligence.”5

Homogenizing the globe’s amorphous analogical tangle of surfaces, sounds, images, accounts, songs, speeches, roads, buildings, documents, messages, and narratives into a planetary digital utility was a feat of immense monetary value.

By making the Internet’s trove of information readily accessible to the public, and extending its reach to the terrestrial plane, Google introduced a fundamentally new technology.

By developing efficient and hassle-free transactional systems, optimizing its computer processing, and driving down costs as it expanded in scale, Google might have garnered massive profits over the years.

Google, however, was not a conventional company. It made the fateful and audacious decision to make all its content and information available free: in economic terms, a commons, available to all, in the spirit of the Internet pioneer Stewart Brand, whose slogan was “Information wants to be free.”

Google doesn’t sweat to supply goods and services for cash and credit. It provides information, art, knowledge, culture, enlightenment, all for no charge.

Apple is an old-style company, charging handsomely for everything it offers. Its CEO, Tim Cook, recall, is the author of the trenchant insight that “if the service is ‘free,’ you are not the customer but the product.”

How do you get rich by giving things away? Google does it through one of the most ingenious technical schemes in the history of commerce.

Page’s and Brin’s crucial insight was that the existing advertising system, epitomized by Madison Avenue, was linked to the old information economy, led by television, which Google would overthrow

The genius of Google was to invent a search advertising model that avoids all the pitfalls it ascribes to existing practices and establishes a new economic model for its system of the world.

Google understands that most advertising most of the time is value-subtracted. That is, to the viewers, ads are overwhelmingly minuses, or even mines. The digital world has accordingly responded with ad-blockers, ad-filters, mutes, Tivos, ad-voids, and other devices to help viewers escape the minuses, the covert exactions, that pay for their free content.

The promise of the Internet under Google’s scheme would be that “no one would have to read or see any unwanted ads.

Analytics uses a “dashboard,” a kind of Google Bloomberg Terminal, that monitors the queries, the yields, the number of advertisers, the number of keywords they bid on, the return on investment of every advertiser.

Like Google, Burning Man might be termed a commons cult: a communitarian religious movement that celebrates giving—free offerings with no expectation of return—as the moral center of an ideal economy of missionaries rather than mercenaries

Echoing the 10 Principles of Burning Man is Google’s corporate page presenting “Our Philosophy,” a guide to its system of the world in the form of “ten things we know to be true.”

Nowhere is there any mention of the need for security.

Security is at the heart of the problems of the Net, and in this case, Google is a source of problems rather than answers.


**End of the Free World**

**Summary**: ...


The Google world is a bounteous and providential kingdom. But it is still based on mediation through advertising at a time when many forms of advertising are in a slow but discernible death spiral.

The whole system which started with newspapers, moved on to radio, then TV, and then various forms of blogging and streaming is basically the same business model:

Gather a bunch of people together who think they’re there for one thing, but are really there for something else.”1 It’s a bait and switch, and no one likes it.

Despite all its heroic advances, Google still gets no less than 95 percent of its revenue from ads tied to its search engine.

“How does the strategy change if the price is zero?”

The answer turned out to be: “We win the entire market.”

He heralded a “zero marginal cost society.” Under the new regime, the price of every incremental good and service, from search to software, from news to energy, will plunge toward “free” as every device and entity in the world is subsumed in an Internet of Things, where exponential network effects yield a new economy of leisure and abundance.

Rifkin assured his audience that it is indeed a Google world.

But not only is “free” a lie, as we’ve seen, but a price of zero signifies a return to the barter system, a morass of incommensurable exchanges that the human race left behind in the Stone Age. 

You pay not with money but with your attention.

Above all, you pay in time. Time is what money measures and represents— what remains scarce when all else becomes abundant in the “zero marginal cost” economy. 

Money signals the real scarcities of the world concealed in the false infinities of free

It’s the “Free World,” and it is reaching past your wallet, spurning your earned money, to seize your time—which is actually your life.

ustomers come first, so in its Chrome browser, Google introduced its own ad-blocker. Google’s angle was that its blocker would apply only to ads condemned by the Coalition for Better Ads. 

In other words, since Google’s ads were famously discreet and camouflaged, it announced it would block the ads of flagrant, garish, or slaphappy rivals. James speculates that this action might be illegal for a search engine.

The most important effect of free, though, is not avoidance of liabilities to real customers. It is escape from the challenges of security.

You rarely have to establish a ground state and defend it. Indeed, in a stream of free goods, the chief hacker is Google and its insidious ad-insert hocus pocus.

This very lack of concern with security, however, will be Google’s undoing.

The problem will be solved. Some thousands of companies you’ve never heard of are investing billions right now in that effort. Collectively they will give birth to a new network whose most powerful architectural imperative will be security of transactions as a property of the system rather than an afterthought.

So fundamental will security be to this new system that its very name will be derived from it. It will be the cryptocosm.


**Ten Laws of the Cryptocosm**

**Summary**: ...

Google’s security foibles, its “aggregate and advertise” model, its avoidance of price signals, its vertical silos of customer data, and its visions of machine mind are unlikely to survive the root-and-branch revolution of distributed peer-to- peer technology, which I call the “cryptocosm.”

Today, all around us, scores of thousands of engineers and entrepreneurs are contriving a new system of the world that transcends the limits and illusions of the Google realm.

In the Google era, the prime rule of the Internet is “Communications first.”

In practice, “free” means insecure, amorphous, unmoored, and changeable from the top.

This communications-first principle served us well for many years. The Internet is a giant asynchronous replicator that communicates by copying.

In this system, security is a function of the network, applied from the top, rather than a property of the device and its owner. So everything rises to the top, the Googleplex, which achieves its speed and efficiency by treating its users as if they were making random choices.

That’s the essence of the mathematical model behind their search engine. You are a random function of Google.

But you are not random; you are a unique genetic entity that cannot be factored back into an egg and a sperm. You are unbreakably encrypted by biology. 

These asymmetrical natural codes are the ruling model and metaphor for enduring security. You start by defining not the goal but the ground state.

Before you build the function or the structure, you build the foundation. It is the ultimate non-random reality. The ground state is you.

Utterly different from Google’s rule of communications first is the law of the cryptocosm. 

The **first rule** is the barn-door law: “Security first.” Security is not a procedure or a mechanism; it is an architecture.

For you, security means not some average level of surveillance at the network level but the safety of your own identity, your own device, and your own property

You occupy and control a specific time and space. 

You cannot be blended or averaged. Just as you are part of a biological ledger, inscribed through time in DNA codes and irreversible by outside power, your properties and transactions compose an immutable ledger.

Just as you are bound in time, every entry in the cryptocosmic ledger is timestamped.

The **second rule** of the cryptocosm derives from the first: “Centralization is not safe.” 

Secure positions are decentralized ones, as human minds and DNA code are decentralized. Darwin’s mistake, and Google’s today, is to imagine that identity is a blend rather than a code—that machines can be a singularity, but human beings are random outcomes.

Centralization tells thieves what digital assets are most valuable and where they are. It solves their most difficult problems. Unless power and information are distributed throughout the system peer to peer, they are vulnerable to manipulation and theft from the blenders at the top.

The **third rule** is “Safety last.” 

Unless the architecture achieves its desired goals, safety and security are irrelevant. Security is a crucial asset of a functional system. 

Requiring the system to be safe at every step of construction results in a kludge: a machine too complex to use.

The **fourth rule** is “Nothing is free. 

This rule is fundamental to human dignity and worth. Capitalism requires companies to serve their customers and to accept their proof of work, which is money. Banishing money, companies devalue their customers.

The **fifth rule** is “Time is the final measure of cost.” Time is what remains scarce when all else becomes abundant: the speed of light and the span of life. The scarcity of time trumps an abundance of money.

The **sixth rule**: “Stable money endows humans with dignity and control.”

Stable money reflects the scarcity of time. Without stable money, an economy is
governed only by time and power.

The **seventh rule** is the “asymmetry law,” reproducing biological asymmetry.

A message coded by a public key can be decrypted only by the private key, but the private key cannot be calculated from the public key. 

Asymmetric codes that are prohibitively difficult to break but easy to verify give power to the people. By contrast, symmetrical encryption gives power to the owners of the most costly computers.

The **eighth rule** is “Private keys rule.” 

They are what is secure. 

They cannot be blended or changed from on top any more than your DNA can be changed or blended from above.

The **ninth rule** is “Private keys are held by individual human beings, not by governments or Google.” Private keys enforce property rights and identities.

Ownership of private keys distributes power. The owner of a private key (ID) can always respond to a challenge by proving ownership of the identity of a public address and the contents of a public ledger.

The **tenth rule** is “Behind every private key and its public key is the human interpreter.” A focus on individual human beings makes meaningful security.


Google is hierarchical. Life after Google will be heterarchical. 

Google is top- down. Life after Google will be bottom-up. 

Google rules by the insecurity of all the lower layers in the stack. A porous stack enables the money and power to be sucked up to the top. 

In life after Google, a secure ground state in the individual human being, registered and timestamped in a digital ledger, will prevent this suction of hierarchical power.


Whereas Google now controls your information and uses it free of charge, you will be master of your own information and charge for it freely.

Try the Brave Browser of Brendan Eich, formerly of Mozilla and the author of JavaScript. It gives you power over your data and enables you to charge for them.

Whereas Google envisages an era of machine dominance through artificial intelligence, you will rule your machines, and they will serve you as intelligent, willing slaves. You will be the “oracle” that programs your life and dictates to your tools.

Whereas Google’s “free world” tries to escape the laws of scarcity and the webs of price, you will live in a world brimming with information on the real costs and most efficient availabilities of what you want and need.

**Google's Datacenter Coup**

**Summary**: ...

The Dalles was to be the spearhead of its new system of the world.

This condensation of big data and vast computing power in the “cloud” is unprecedented in the history of computing. These machines gain control of their environment by excelling all others in the speed and density of their computations and transactions and in the size of their data stores.

Such servers are behind new centers of dominance in industries as diverse as retailing and finance, insurance and real estate. But Google’s are the most dominant of all.

According to Bell’s Law, every decade a hundredfold drop in the price of processing power engenders a new computer architecture.

The Google worldwide warehouse arises from this once futuristic terabyte paradigm, but its operating environment is now the peta-scale—petabytes, petaops, petaflops.

Today Google reigns over a database of thousands of petabytes, called exa-bytes, swelled every twenty-four hours by scores of terabytes of Gmails, Facebook pages, presidential twitter feeds, and videos—a relentless march of daily deltas, each larger than the whole Web of a decade ago

Replicated around the globe, this Bell’s Law machine in The Dalles is at the heart of Google’s hegemony.

Google designed and manufactured its own servers from cheap commodity components made by microprocessor star Intel and hard-drive king Seagate.

The price of high-end processors “goes up nonlinearly with [their] performance,” he observed. That is, Intel’s high-end microprocessors cost increasingly more than they are worth in incremental output

We have now run into a brick wall. What brought all of us faster computing was raising the CPU’s clock rate [its speed per compute cycle measured in hertz or cycles per second]. A faster clock increased power consumption. We could only increase the clock rate without consuming more power because we could lower the voltage. But we can’t do that anymore because **we’re down into electron volts where quantum uncertainty takes over. If you can’t lower the voltage, you can’t raise the clock rate without using a lot more power.**

It is harder to accelerate the clock rate and reduce the heat emissions than it is to multiply transistors storing bits in memory chips. As memory grows more rapidly than microprocessor operations, faster microprocessors tend to bog down in memory accesses. 

Hölzle’s solution, driven by Larry Page, was promising: jamming together innumerable cheap processors in parallel and linking them with fiber-optic lines at the speed of light. 

Ingenious new software made them work together. That was at least a theoretical path to a scalable system in which bang for the buck didn’t diminish as the system grew

The essential first step in the coup. By building its own infrastructure rather than relying on commercial data centers, Google got “tremendous competitive advantage,” Schmidt told analysts at the time.

Wasting what is abundant to conserve what is scarce, the G-men have become the supreme entrepreneurs of the new millennium.

It is the Google era. But hovering over the massively parallel, prodigally productive petascale computer like a midday emanation over Death Valley is a shimmering haze of heat.

Air conditioning will be the prime cost and conundrum of the petascale era.

Hydropower is a limited and localized resource, while nuclear power promises centuries of nearly limitless energy that can be produced almost anywhere. China plans to build as many as forty newfangled nuclear plants; the next wave of data centers may well be in Shenzhen.

For now, though, Google has attained one of the holy grails of computer science: a scalable massively parallel architecture that can accommodate diverse software while poring through petabytes of big data.

Its petascale search machine in place, Google then faced the question: What else could it do? 

Google’s answer: just about anything. 

Google and the others suck into their proprietary clouds more and more of the duties once delegated to the CPU. Optical networks, which move data over vast distances without degradation, allow computing to migrate to wherever power is cheapest

The Googleplex at the center of the sphere will soon dwarf the Internet itself.

If CPUs won’t run much cooler, he reasons, maybe the rest of the computer can be redesigned to keep power consumption to a minimum. That’s his goal. Some industry veterans believe that Bechtolsheim doesn’t count for much in the era of cloud computing

Bechtolsheim believes that the move from search to more ambitious services plays to Google’s advantage. “To deliver video, maps, and all the rest on the fly, optimized for a specific customer’s needs, to get the maximum benefit for the advertiser—that requires tremendous hardware, storage, and memory. It takes hundreds of computers free to each end user. The next tier down doesn’t have the economics to build this stuff.”

The last few years have been disappointing for people who want to accelerate progress in technology. But now the world is moving faster again.”

The next wave of innovation will compress today’s parallel solutions in an evolutionary convergence of electronics and optics: 3D and even holographic memory cells; lasers inscribed on the tops of chips, replacing copper pins with streams of photons; and all-optical networks in which thousands of colors of light travel along a single fiber. As these advances find their way into an increasing variety of devices, the petascale computer will shrink from a dinosaur to a teleputer—the successor to today’s handhelds—in your ear or in your signal path. It will access an endless variety of sensors, searchers, and servers.

These innovations will enable participation in metaverses that seem to play to the strength of Google’s cloud, which will link to trillions of sensors around the globe. (IPhone8 has sixteen different sensor systems, from an array of radio frequency devices to gyroscopes, accelerometers, barometers, and imagers galore.) A planetary sensorium will give Google a constant knowledge of the physical state of the world, from traffic conditions to the workings of your own biomachine.

Will the
Sirens offer a new machine of economic growth and progress, investment and capital accumulation, and continued economic dominance? Or is The Dalles a monument to an expiring business strategy? Are the days of centralization over?














  
  
  
  














## qWeb3 Dream State

Trumbull’s analog 3D achieved full immersion without 3D glasses or VR goggles. Eat your heart out, Silicon Valley.

The journey took only four minutes, but its virtual-reality intensity dilated time. Our eyes popping, our hearts racing, our lungs swollen, we felt as if we had been in the car for two hours. At least. We had actually undergone a form of time travel.

But it will do doors—your front door and your car door and doors of perception

Google is hierarchical. Life after Google will be heterarchical. 

Google is top- down. Life after Google will be bottom-up. 

Google rules by the insecurity of all the lower layers in the stack. A porous stack enables the money and power to be sucked up to the top. 

In life after Google, a secure ground state in the individual human being, registered and timestamped in a digital ledger, will prevent this suction of hierarchical power.


Whereas Google now controls your information and uses it free of charge, you will be master of your own information and charge for it freely.

Try the Brave Browser of Brendan Eich, formerly of Mozilla and the author of JavaScript. It gives you power over your data and enables you to charge for them.

Whereas Google envisages an era of machine dominance through artificial intelligence, you will rule your machines, and they will serve you as intelligent, willing slaves. You will be the “oracle” that programs your life and dictates to your tools.

Whereas Google’s “free world” tries to escape the laws of scarcity and the webs of price, you will live in a world brimming with information on the real costs and most efficient availabilities of what you want and need.

The proof of your work will trump the claims of top-down speed and hierarchical power. The crude imperatives of “free” will give way to the calibrated voluntary exchanges of free markets and micropayments.

Whereas the Google world strains you through sieves of diversity and runs you through blenders of conformity, the new world will subsist on the foundational realities of individual uniqueness and choice. 

Whereas the Google world is stifling entrepreneurs’ access to the public markets through initial public offerings, which are down 90 percent in two decades, the new world will offer an array of new paths to enterprise. From initial coin offerings and token issues to crowd-funded projects, new financial devices are already empowering a new generation of entrepreneurs.

The queues of abject “unicorns”—privately held start-ups worth a billion dollars or more—outside the merger and acquisition offices of Google and its rivals will be dispersed, replaced by herds of “gazelles” headed for public markets at last.2

Whereas Google attempts to capture your eyeballs with ubiquitous advertisements, you will see advertisements at your own volition, when you want them, and you will be paid for your time and attention. Again, Brave is the leader of this movement.

Money is not a magic wand but a measuring stick, not wealth but a gauge of it. Whereas money in the Google era is fodder for a five-trillion-dollar-a-day currency exchange—that’s seventy-five times the amount of the world’s trade in goods and services—you will command unmediated money that measures value rather than manipulates it.

Whereas the Google world is layered with middlemen and trusted third parties, you will deal directly with others around the globe with scant fees or delays.

Emerging is a peer-to-peer swarm of new forms of direct transactions beyond national borders and new forms of Uber and Airbnb beyond corporate gouges

Star Trek was a world without money, without material scarcity. AI wanted to be like us, not replace us. It’s a future I think about a lot these days.

Language and writing, agriculture and industrialization, science and technology — each further abstracted the cost of transactions in the material world to more transcendental metrics of currency and paid labor.

Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies are shifting the world’s purchasing power from dollars to bits, unlocking a universe of value and services beyond anything that’s been possible in prior models, just as the Internet did before it.

When renewable energy and 3D printing commoditize the cost and scarcity of acquiring material goods and services, the center of gravity in our worldwide economy will be the blockchain, not fiat currencies.

AI and full automation of the service economy will come next. This disruption will pose deeper challenges to the workforce and world economy than globalization or factory robots.

Jobs and commercial skills which can be learned or imparted through human instruction, higher education, or training — whether physical, mental or analytical — are at risk of being taken over by machine learning in the coming decades.

When this happens we may have no choice other than to recalibrate the currency of human labor, skill and education.

When 95% of the world moved from farming to industrial work, the collective mindshare of humanity was free to focus on reality defining expansions of civilization 

With billions of us connected to each other (and to all collective human knowledge), we are more empowered than any previous generation to collaborate on a better system for us that is built on top of AI, not displaced by it.

**A first principle in the “Render Economy” is that the resonance of authentic human thought, creativity and imagination are the fundamental units of currency**

When AI has parity with more rarified levels of intelligent human skill and labor, it will only be commoditizing the value of human work, never human worth. 

That worth can only be rendered by us, as humans, reinforcing and refining its collective expression for the betterment of our social fabric — a spiritual blockchain of sorts that only the human experience can validate and participate in.

Our complete personal experience is a uniquely human metric by which we constantly measure qualia, social resonance and novel truths. 

No machine can ever do this more authentically and meaningfully than we do. 

In a decentralized, dematerialized and fully automated world, the flow and final evaluation of human value must never stop being a human responsibility.

The Render Token and the network that it encompasses are built to enable such a system’s viability as early as possible. First, through massive cost savings in distributed rendering that bootstrap the render economy in its early stages. Then, in subsequent phases to come, through a semantic web of value and authorship encoded in the blockchain itself.

The RNDR network, at launch, is driven by human intent to receive render work that matches the expectation and acceptance of its human author (who has invested value into his or her creation). 

Proof of render work, removal of watermarks, and an exchange of tokens for final output is triggered by a human action, not an algorithm. Human authentication at the beginning and end of the token exchange process is the driving value of this economy, no matter what secondary layers are digitized, computed or automated.

In a post-automation world, AI may ultimately evolve to the point where it can generate our media, art, stories, synthetic experiences and expose us to novel and meaningful truths. 

This may feel like it threatens the sacred final frontier of human creative output. 

But we should remember that even if AI one day powers the entire economy of creating thought and art, the only transactional unit of currency in such a system, will be when we, as humans, render it valuable.
