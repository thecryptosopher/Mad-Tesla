## Problems of Classical Blockchain Architecture

**qBitcoin (Ikeda)**

However its security basically relies on cryptography based on the
computation hardness assumptions in terms of classical computers and recent
advances on quantum computers constitute a grave menace to the safety

It is believed that quantum computers can hasten the mining process and may
crack the SHA256 hash algorithm used by Bitcoin network. Actually it is
reported that the classical signature scheme used by Bitcoin is at risk and
could be completely broken by quantum attack within a couple of decades

In order to solve this issue, we try to transplant it on a quantum network and to
quantize the whole system by use of all quantum technologies which keep on
evolving

On the other hand, this issue was crucial in
Bitcoin and the blockchain system was invented to solve it. However, this
causes another problem: making a block is time-consuming and one needs
to wait more than 10 minutes to complete a transaction. qBitcoin is made
of a network connecting points, rather than blocks. Therefore the quantized
system will succeed in transmitting money much faster than Bitcoin.

In the conventional banking systems including Bitcoin, their security
systems rely on cryptography whose security is guaranteed temporarily by the
computational hardness assumption as represented by integer factorization
algorithms and elliptic curve cryptography. 

However it is widely known that
a quantum computer manages to break such conventional code in a short
time. So it is wise to find an alternative method. In qBitcoin, we employ
quantum cryptography which is secure since it is protected by the laws of
physics, hence it is secure forever in principle.

Solutions: qCryptography, qTeleportation, qSignatures

Security based on Quantum Mechanics

Moreover, traditional Bitcoin uses the classical coding, hence it is important to find an alternative way. To fix this problem,
quantum digital signature schemes, which is quantum mechanical digital signature, are in development to provide protection against tampering, even
from parties in possession of quantum computers and using powerful quantum cheating strategies.

qBitcoin solves this point by using quantum digital signature of type
proposed by Gottesman and Chuang. There owners’ private keys are not
secret and any key is not link to themselves. Moreover owners can generate
keys as many as they like hence it is impossible even to guess to whom they
belong

In practice, it will be also important to consider how one who does not
oppose a quantum computer can use quantum money since only a limited
number of people will be able to have a first generation quantum computer.

In this case, one who wants to trade quantum money will be forced to access to
a quantum computer at an exchange. Here question is how to protect owner’s
privacy. Fortunately we have a good solution to this issue. 

Namely, so called
blind quantum computation [7, 8] is a secure protocol which enables a client
(Alice) without a quantum computer to delegate her quantum computation
to a server (Bob) with a fully fledged quantum technology in such a way
that Bob cannot obtain any information about Alice’s actual input, output,
and algorithm.

On the other hand, establishing classical blind computation in a practical manner
is still open problem. That is to say, in the conventional Bitcoin, private
information of coin owners is stored at market place and can be leaked out.

In his scheme, quantum money was secure in the sense that it
cannot be copied due to the no-cloning theorem, however there were several
problems.

There is a survey on trying to quantize
Bitcoin [21] based on a classical blockchain system and a classical digital
signature protocol proposed in [20]. However, all of those works rely on
classical digital signature protocols and classical coin transmission system,
hence computational hardness assumptions are vital to their systems. In
other words, if a computer equipped with ultimate computational ability
appears someday, the money systems above are in danger of collapsing, as
the bank systems today face.
